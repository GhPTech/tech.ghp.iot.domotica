Internet of Things Tutorial</h1>

This tutorial shows how to develop a typical [Internet of Things (IoT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things "Internet of Thinks on Wikipedia") application for [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) based on the [OSGi enRoute template](http://enroute.osgi.org/tutorial_iot/050-start.html). 

##Prerequisites

The following software is needed:
* [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [Eclipse Mars](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
* [Git] (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Bndtools] (http://bndtools.org/installation.html#update-site) version 3.1.0 or later.

Details on how to install *bndtools* can be found on the web site http://bndtools.org/installation.html

*Bndtools* can  be installed from *Eclipse Marketplace*. Alternatively, it can be installed from:

     https://dl.bintray.com/bndtools/bndtools/latest

You can find the details how to install bndtools on the bndtools website

The necessary hardware consist of:

* Raspberry Pi 2 model B setup with [NOOBS]  (https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/new-raspbian-and-noobs-releases/) (includes Java 1.8)
* LEDs 
* resistors \pm 220\Omega 
* breadboard
* buttons
* male-female wires

##The Bnd Workspace

OSGi enRoute requires that the files belonging to a specific project are grouped in a *bnd workspace*. A *Bnd workspace* is a directory with a *cnf* folder and a number of projects. The *cnf* folder contains a *build.bnd* file and a *ext* directory which together define the workspace properties. A *Bnd workspace* is like a module; it imports bundles (and JARs) from a repository and it exports bundles to the same or another repository. On the inside we have projects that are private to the workspace. The projects should be cohesive so that they can share information via the *cnf* project.

###The GitHub workspace

The *GitHub workspace* is intended for sharing on [GitHub](https://github.com). The *bnd* template workspace can be obtained from [GitHub](https://github.com/GhPTech/workspace).

	 $ cd  ~/git
	 $ git init tech.ghp.iot.domotica
	 $ cd tech.ghp.iot.domotica
	 $ git fetch --depth=1 https://github.com/GhPTech/workspace master
	 $ git checkout FETCH_HEAD -- .

###The Eclipse workspace

The *Eclipse workspace* stores *metadata* with personal preferences and history, which should not be shared through GitHub. *Bnd* is able to build independent of Eclipse preferences.

In order to create/select an *Eclipse workspace*, select _File/Switch Workspace/Other ..._ fill in the path accordingly. For the present tutorial the *Eclipse Workspace* should be as follows:

*~/eclipse/tech.ghp.iot.domotica*

###Workbench view

In order to get the *Workbench* view, push the *Workbench* button from On the top right corner of *Eclipse* window.

###Import the *Bnd Workspace*

The best way to work with projects in Eclipse is to not store them in the Eclipse workspace folder but import them from the *GitHub workspace*.

From the context menu (right click) select 
	 
*@/Import -> General/Existing Projects into Workspace*

then select the corresponding *Bnd Workspace* from *GitHub*. For the present tutorial, the following path:

*~/git/tech.ghp.iot.domotica*
    
Finish the import process,by pushing the *Finish* button.

This will import the cnf project into your Eclipse workspace.

###The *Bndtools* perspective

The *Bndtools* perspective gives access to specific *Bnd* tools. For this perspective, from the main menu, select 

*Window/Perspective/OpenPerspective/Bndtools*

##Application project

From main menu select *File/New/Bndtools Projects*. Select the *OSGI enRoute* template and give the name *tech.ghp.iot.domotica.application*.


###Code

The OSGI enRoute template drafts the source code for the application in the file */src/DomoticaApplication.java*.

	 package tech.ghp.iot.domotica.application;
	 
	 import org.osgi.service.component.annotations.Component;
	 
	 import osgi.enroute.configurer.api.RequireConfigurerExtender;
	 import osgi.enroute.google.angular.capabilities.RequireAngularWebResource;
	 import osgi.enroute.rest.api.REST;
	 import osgi.enroute.twitter.bootstrap.capabilities.RequireBootstrapWebResource;
	 import osgi.enroute.webserver.capabilities.RequireWebServerExtender;
	 

	 @RequireAngularWebResource(resource={"angular.js","angular-resource.js", "angular-route.js"}, priority=1000)
	 @RequireBootstrapWebResource(resource="css/bootstrap.css")
	 @RequireWebServerExtender
	 @RequireConfigurerExtender
	 @Component(name="tech.ghp.upper")
	 public class DomoticaApplication implements REST {

			public String getUpper(RESTRequest req, String string) throws Exception{
			return string.toUpperCase();
			}

It includes web resources for our application like Angular, Bootstrap, and the web extender that serves the static pages. 
The component annotation that makes this object a *Declarative Services service component*. A service component is automatically registered as a service when it implements an interface and it can depend on other services.

The *UpperApplication* component implements the *REST* interface and is thus registered as a *REST service*. The contract of this service indicates that any public method in this class becomes available as a *REST end-point*. 

The *getUpper* method is for the *GET* method and it is mapped from the /rest/upper URI. Since it accepts a single argument, we can specify the word we want to upper case as /rest/upper/<word>. More information about the *REST API* can be found in the [service catalog](http://enroute.osgi.org/services/osgi.enroute.rest.api.html).

###HTML resources

Some static resources for the *Javascript code* and *CSS* are also needed for the web application. 


The resources from this application are stored in the directory *static* (included in the bundle). These resources are directly mapped to the root, i.e. a resource with the path *static/abc/def* will be available as */abc/def*. 

The recommendation is to create a static direction with the application PID name in static.

	 static/
	 			tech.ghp.iot.domotica
				index.html
				...


The *static/tech.ghp.iot.domotica/index.html* directroy contains the single page HTML root. It defines a header, view area, and a footer. 

The *tech.ghp.iot.domotica/main/htm* directory contains html fragments that are inserted in the main page depending on the URI. 

These resources use macros from the build environment.

###Automatic Resources

The file *index.html* file contains the following entries:

	 <link 
	 		rel="stylesheet" 
	 		type="text/css"
			href="/osgi.enroute.webresource/${bsn}/${Bundle-Version}/*.css">

	 <script 
			src="/osgi.enroute.webresource/${bsn}/${Bundle-Version}/*.js">
	 </script>

OSGi enRoute automatically insert any CSS or Javascript code required (through annotation) for the bundle. Additionally, at the end it will add code in bundleâ€™s web directory.

###Runtime

The requirements of the *runtime* need to be defined in the *tech.ghp.iot.domotica.bndrun* file. These can be defined from the *Run* tab. By default, the requirements are specified via annotations, the application *tech.ghp.iot.domotica.application* is listed in the initial requirements. Other bundles can be added from the *Browse Repos* list (the left side of the *Run* tab). 

As the *Run Requirements* list is complete, the *Resolve* button needs to be pushed in order to get the bundles required by the runtime. This will set the *Run Bundles* list. The *-runbundles* section of the script is overwritten every time the *Resolve* button is pushed (manual editing of the *-runbundles* section would be lost).

Save the file *tech.ghp.iot.domotica.bndrun*. 

Push the button *Debug OSGi* at the right top of the window.

The application is running at the address 

    http://localhost:8080/tech.ghp.iot.domotica
    
By pushing the button *To Upper* will transform the string inserted in the dialog window to upper case.

###Executable

In order to run the application on an arbitrary environment, an executable JAR can be 
created. The JAR include all the dependencies of the launcher and the framework. 

The executable JAR is created by selecting the *project_name.bndrun* file with the *Run* tab and by pushing the *Export* button form the right top side of the window. This will initiate an *Export Wizard Selection* in which, the name and the path of the executable JAR file are chosen. 

The created executable JAR can be run from the command line at the chosen location:

    cd ~/[chosen_path]

The Java version at the target environment should be verified (Java version 1.8.0 is required):

    java -version
 
Make sure that no other framework is running on the target environment.

The executable JAR can be run with the command:

    java -jar tech.ghp.iot.domotica.jar
    
The application can be used/accessed from the address:

    http://localhost:8080/tech.ghp.iot.domotica

To stop the application do *Control-C* at the command line.

    ^C

##Separate functionality

The purpose of the *DomoticaApplication* class is to be an interface of the underlying services. It is not recommended to provide functionality to such interfaces. 

*OSGi enRoute* has a special templates for various projects types:

* Application projects *.application*, bind together a set of components and parametrizes them
* API projects *.api*, defines the service
* Provider projects *.provider*, *.adapter*, implements a project
* Test Projects *.test*, runs tests inside the framework


###API Project

An Application Programming Interface (API) is recommended in order to separate interface code from implementation code. The API  is like a service contract. The best practice is to give service contracts their own projects so they can be easily shared. For API projects, the sufix of the name should be *.api*. OSGi enRoute recognises this suffix and will select the appropriate layout for the API project.

To create the API project, from the main menu select

*File/New/Bndtools Project*

select the *OSGi enRoute* template and give the following name:

*tech.ghp.iot.domotica.api*

The *OSGI enRoute* template creates a project with all the options set to treat it as an API. The templates creates the *Domotica* interface in the right package. The *Domotica* class should specify that the *Domotica* interface converts an input string to upper case as follows:

     package tech.ghp.iot.domotica.api;
	
	 import org.osgi.annotation.versioning.ProviderType;

	 /**
 	 * A service that turns a string to uppercase
 	 */
	 @ProviderType
	 public interface Domotica {
	 	/**
	 	* Turn a string into upper case
	 	*/
	
	 	String upper(String input);
	}


In the *generated* folder of the project, the file *tech.ghp.iot.domotica.api.jar* is created. This file contains the *Manifest*, which was generated by *bnd*. 
The *Manifest* shows that the package *tech.ghp.iot.domotica.api* is exported. This means that this package is available for other bundles. The *Contents* tab of the *bnd.bnd* file shows the *Export packages* list.  

![tech.ghp.iot.domotica.api](http://enroute.osgi.org/img/tutorial_base/project-create-5.png "The box with rounded corners represents a bundle; the inside black box represents an exported package. The package 'tech.ghp.upper.api' is exported and made available to other bundles. ")

The *version* of this package is defined in the file *package-info.java*. 

    @org.osgi.annotation.versioning.Version("1.0.0")
    package tech.ghp.iot.domotica.api;

The modifications of this package should be reflected in the specified version. Any modification that affects the public API must result in a rebuild of the bundle of the *provider*(the party that implements the *Domotica* interface). For example, if the version goes to *1.1*, the bundels that implemented *1.0* should no longer be compatible. In order to assure that the proper version ranges are used, the following annotation should be added:

    @ProviderType
    public interface Domotica { ... }
    
By making this annotation, the *bndtool* will automatically ensure that the *providers/implementers* of the respective interface  use semantic versioning to import the package with a minor range, *1.0, 1.0*.

The default implemented interfaces of the API (usually listener like interfaces) are *consumer* type and could be annotated as

    @ConsumerType
    
The *bnd* project is driven by the *bnd.bnd* file, which defines the *version*, the *build path* and which packages should go into the bundle. For example, the source of the *bnd.bnd* file is as follows:

    Bundle-Version:1.0.0.${tstamp}
    Bundle-Description: 				\
	    This is  project. An API project should in general not contain any \
	    implementation code.\
	    \
	    ${warning;Please update this Bundle-Description in tech.ghp.iot.domotica.api/bnd.bnd}

     Export-Package:  \
	     tech.ghp.iot.domotica.api;provide:=true


     Require-Capability: \
	     compile-only

    -buildpath: \
	     osgi.enroute.base.api;version=1.0

    -testpath: \
	    osgi.enroute.junit.wrapper;version=4.12


###Provider Project

As the API (the service contract) is defined, a provider (an implementation) of the proposed service is required. The *provider* implements the *API* so the users (the clients) can employ the *service*. The *provider projects* have the *.provider* suffix. The root name should be the same as the workspace name. 

To create a *provider* project, from the main menu select

*File/New/Bndtools Project*

select the *OSGi enRoute* template and give the following name:

*tech.ghp.iot.domotica.provider*

The *OSGi enRoute* template creates the *DomoticaImpl.java* file, which includes the *@Component* annotation in order to setup the *Declarative Service (DS)* and the *DomoticaImpl* class.

####Implementation

As the *DomoticaImpl* component class implements the *Domotica* interface, this implementation needs to be registed as an *Domotica* service. This registration is specified as follows:

    @Component(name = "tech.ghp.iot.domotica")
    public class DomoticaImpl implements Domotica { }

#####Build Path

As the *Domotica* interface is not a part of the *provider project*, the compilation and the build of the code cannot be carried out. A *build path* to the *api project* has to be provided to the *bnd.bnd* file.

The *buildpath* can be edited with the *Build* tab of the *bnd.bnd* file by adding the  *tech.ghp.iot.domotica.api* bundle. Alternatively, the *buildpath* can be edited with the *Source* tab as 

    -buildpath: \
	    osgi.enroute.base.api;version=1.0,\
	    tech.ghp.iot.domotica.api;version=latest

#####Imports

The *bnd.bnd* files defines the dependencies of the bundle. It consists of 

* *Private packages*: packages only available the current bundle;
* *Exported packages*: packages exported to other bundles;
* *Imported packages*: packages provided to the current bundle;

In order to recognise the *Domotica* type, the class *DomoticaImpl* has to import the package *tech.ghp.iot.domotica.api* to get the *Domotica* interface.

    import tech.ghp.iot.domotica.api.Domotica;

In this case, the user of the *Domotica* service would depend on two bundles: *tech.ghp.iot.domotica.api* and *tech.ghp.iot.domotica.provider*. 

![tech.ghp.iot.domotica.api/tech.ghp.iot.domotica.provider](http://enroute.osgi.org/img/tutorial_base/provider-imports-1.png "The box with rounded corners represents a bundle; the inside black box represents an exported package. The bundle is importing the *tech.ghp.iot.domotica.api* package to get the *Domotica* interface.")

To avoid this double dependency, the *API* bundle can be exported to the *provider* bundle. In order to export the *API* bundle, add the package *tech.ghp.iot.domotica.api* to the *Export Packages*. 

![tech.ghp.iot.domotica.api/tech.ghp.iot.domotica.provider](http://enroute.osgi.org/img/tutorial_base/provider-imports-3.png "The box with rounded corners represents a bundle; the inside black box represents an exported package. By exporting the *com.acme.prime.eval.api*, the bundle *com.acme.prime.eval.provider* is independent.")

#####Code

The *Domotica* interface specifies the *upper* method as follows

    public interface Domotica {
	     String upper(String input);
    }

This method needs to be provided by the *DomoticaImpl* class.

For this trivial example, the provider only has to return the input and convert it to uppercase with the function *toUpperCase* (already available in the Java library of the method *input*):

    @Component(name = "tech.ghp.iot.domotica")
    public class DomoticaImpl implements Domotica {
    	public String upper(String input){
				return input.toUpperCase();
			}
	}

The *provider* can both implement and/or be a *client* of the interfaces in a *service* package. The *provider* and the *client* roles have consequences on the versioning of the packages. Any change in the *service* contract (API) require an update of the *privider* (implementation).

The best practice in OSGi for a *provider* is to include *service* (API) codes and export it. However, the *provider* code and the *api* codes should not be part of the same project because the compilation of the *api* would expose the *provider* (implementation) code.

#####Test the Provider with (Standard) JUnit

The implementation (the provider) of the service should be tested before it is released. Testing saves time and resources in the later phases of the development process.  

A *provider* should have *JUnit* tests. These tests have access to private information about the implementation details and proprieties of the components that are not part of the public API. When these tests fail they prohibit the release of the project. 

The *OSGi enRoute template* includes a test case in the *test* directory. The *DomoticaImplTest* test is placed in the same package as the *DomoticaImpl* class, but is not part of the bundle. As it is in the same package, it has access at the private information of the *DomoticaImpl* class. 

For the present template a simple test will be run as follows:

    package tech.ghp.iot.domotica.provider;
    import junit.framework.TestCase;

    public class DomoticaImplTest extends TestCase {
    
    		public void testSimple() throws Exception {
					DomoticaImpl text = new DomoticaImpl();
					
					String str1 = new String("POPOVICI");
					String str2 = new String(text.upper("Popovici"));
					assertEquals(str1,str2);
			}
	}

To run the test from the *context menu* (right click) select

*@Run As/JUnit Test*    

For debugging, *breakpoints* can be inserted at the code lines where the running programe should stop. Tu run a test in *debug* mode, select

*@Debug As/JUnit Tests*

The *JUnit* runner creates a new *VM* with the same *build-path* as the class it tests. All the tests dependencies must be on the *build-path* in order to run the tests. 

* *JUnit 4.x* requires annotations on the test class. Extensions of *TestCase* in the class are not necessary (annotations are ignored).
* *JUnit 3.x* must extend *TestCase* (usually the easiest way to write tests)

###Update the Application project

As initially drafted, the *application* bundle had no dependencies on the *Domotica* service defined by the *api* bundle (and implemented by the *provider* bundle).

In order to refer to the defined service, the *application* bundle should include the *api* bundle to the build path. 

Convention is to place references at the end of the *application* class. Reference to the *Domotica* service can be made as follows:

    @Reference
    Domotica 		upper;

The *@Reference* annotation creates a dependency on this service. The *DomoticaApplication* component is not initiated until the service registry contains an *Domotica* service.

Now the initial instruction to return a string to upper case,

    return string.toUpperCase();
    
is replaced by the instruction to return *upper* string as declared in *Domotica* class implemented in *DomoticaImpl* class.

Finally, the reference to  *tech.ghp.iot.domotica.api* should be provided to the *application* bundle. This can be done by pushing the *Resolve* button of the *tech.ghp.upper.bndrun* file of the *tech.ghp.iot.domotica.application* project. 

Check if the bundle *tech.ghp.iot.domotica.provider* was added to the list of *Run Bundles*. 

###Test in OSGi

In order to test the *service contracts*, *OSGi JUnit tests* are run. A sperate project is needed for testing. The contentent of these tests should be available to other projects. 

Select *New/Bndtools Project/*, choose *OSGi enRoute* template and name it *tech.ghp.iot.domotica.test*. 

The *OSGi enRoute* template provides a simple test case with *Bundle Context*, but does not include the *Upper* service.

    package tech.ghp.iot.domotica.test;
    import org.junit.Assert;
    import org.junit.Test;
    import org.osgi.framework.BundleContext;
    import org.osgi.framework.FrameworkUtil;
    public class DomoticaTest {

    private final BundleContext context = FrameworkUtil.getBundle(this.getClass()).getBundleContext();
    
    @Test
    public void testDomotica() throws Exception {
    	Assert.assertNotNull(context);
    	}
    }

In order to include the *Domotica* service the following code is needed:

    <T> T getService(Class<T> clazz) throws InterruptedException {
		ServiceTracker<T,T> st = new ServiceTracker<>(context, clazz, null);
		st.open();
		return st.waitForService(1000);
	}

Assertion of service existence is also needed:

    Assert.assertNotNull(getService(Domotica.class));

As the *Domotica* class is recognised by the current project, the *tech.ghp.iot.domotica.api* project needs to be included on the *BuildPath* of the *bnd.bnd* file (*tech.ghp.iot.domotica.test* project). 
Also *import* of the *Upper* and the *ServiceTracker* classes need to be done into the source code *DomoticaTest* file.

    import org.osgi.util.tracker.ServiceTracker;
    import tech.ghp.upper.api.Domotica;

Finally, the dependencies need to be *resolved* from the *Run* tab of the *bnd.bnd* file. As a result the following bundles will be added into the *Run Bundles* list:

    -runbundles: \
		tech.ghp.iot.domotica.provider;version=snapshot,\
		tech.ghp.iot.domotica.test;version=snapshot,\
		org.apache.felix.configadmin;version='[1.8.6,1.8.7)',\
		org.apache.felix.log;version='[1.0.1,1.0.2)',\
		org.apache.felix.scr;version='[2.0.0,2.0.1)',\
		org.eclipse.equinox.metatype;version='[1.4.100,1.4.101)',\
		org.osgi.service.metatype;version='[1.3.0,1.3.1)',\
		osgi.enroute.hamcrest.wrapper;version='[1.3.0,1.3.1)',\
		osgi.enroute.junit.wrapper;version='[4.12.0,4.12.1)'

To run the test select the *bnd.bnd* file and from the *context menu* (right click) select 

*@/Debug As/Bnd OSGi Test Launcher (JUnit)*

As it is, the test only checks if the service exists. Other tests can be added as necessary. For example, to check if the string *Popovici* is converted to upper case string *POPOVICI*, the following test is added:

    @Test
    public void testText() throws Exception {
    	Assert.assertEquals( new String("POPOVICI"), getService(Domotica.class).upper("Popovici"));

This test case can be run separately from *context menu* of *testText* function as *Debug As/Bnd OSGi Test Launcher (JUnit)*.

Test bundles are marked with the heander *Test-Cases*. This header contains a list with class names that contain *JUnit* tests. The *Source* tab of the *bnd.bnd* file contains the header 

    Test-Cases: ${test-cases}

The *${test-cases}* macro is set by OSGi enRoute template, which either extend the *junit.framework.TestCase* class or use the JUnit 4 annotations like *@Test*. In the present example, the expansion is as follows (*generated/tech.ghp.iot.domotica.test.jar*):

     Test-Cases: tech.ghp.iot.domotica.test.DomoticaTest
     
When a OSGI JUnit test is launched, bnd creates a new framework with the set run bundles. On the class path (for the current framework), bundle *aQute.junit* is added as well as the JARs listed on the *-testpath*. The features available for running a *usual framework* are also available for running a *test framework*, e.g. *-runproprieties*, *-runtrace*.

Once all bundles are started, the *aQute.junit* bundle searches for the header *Test-Cases*, loads the classes and run the specified tests.

If the tests are run from *Eclipse JUnit* framework, the *bnd* sets up a new framework and passes a set of classes/methods that Eclipse has chosen from a given selection. The *aQute.junit* will then execute only those classes/methods and report the results back to Eclipse for the JUnit view.

##Continous Integration

The current application *tech.ghp.iot.domotica* is build by Eclipse IDE. This is useful for local usage and development, however the philosophy of *open source* and *collaborative development* should be considered. Moreover, when application building is carried out on the personal system, many dependencies accumulate. These dependencies are not suitable for *collaborative development* and *open source*. Automatic building from the command line should also be carried out.

###Automatic building

*OSGi enRoute* includes a full *Gradle* build. The *gradlew* script downloads the appropriate *gradle* version (Java version 1.8 should be available):

    $ cd ~/git/tech.ghp.iot.domotica
    $ java -version
    java version "1.8.0"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment ...
    $ ./gradlew
    Downloading https://b../biz.aQute.bnd-latest.jar to 
    /Users/aqute/git/tech.ghp.iot.domotica/cnf/cache/biz.aQute.bnd-latest.jar ... 
    :help

The possible *gradle tasks* can be obtained with the command
    
    $./gradlew tasks

To automatically builds the application *tech.ghp.upper* from the command line, the following command is used:

    $./gradlew export.tech.ghp.iot.domotica
    
This will create and store the JAR *tech.ghp.iot.domotica.jar* on the path 
*tech.ghp.iot.domotica.api/generated/distributions/executable/*

###Sharing

In order share the development, the project can be pushed to the *GitHub*. 

On the GitHub home page [GitHub](https://github.com/GhPTech), a new repository has to be created. Name this repository *tech.ghp.upper*, add a short description 'An example workspace fro the osgi.enroute base tutorial' and set the repository as 'Public' (do not set initialise the 'README' file, do no add 'gitnore' and license).

[!GitHub Repository](http://enroute.osgi.org/img/tutorial_base/ci-github-1.png "Create a New Repository dialog")


In order to connect to the local repository *!/git/tech.ghp.iot.domotica*, the 'SSH URI' *git@github.com:GhPTech/tech.ghp.iot.domotica.git* needs to be copied, then on the command line the following commands should be launched:

    $ cd ~/git/tech.ghp.iot.domotica
	$ git add .
	$ git commit -m "first commit"
	$ git remote add origin git@github.com:GhPTech/tech.ghp.iot.domotica.git
	$ git push -u origin master

For further commits and pushes the following commands are used:

    $ git add .
	$ git commit -m "[commit message]"
	$ git push -u origin master

#Continous Integration

The *bnd workspace* is setup to be built continuously with *Travis CI*. 

From the *Travis CI* website [!https://travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org "Travis CI website") *create an account* based on GitHub credentials (or *login*). 

Once logged in, select the *Repositories* tab. The *Sync Now* button should be pushed in order to update the latests changes from *GitHub*. Find the 'com.acme.prime' repository and push the *ON* button. Every push will now be automatically build the repository 'com.acme.prime' on the *Travis IC* server. 

In order to trigger the build on *Travis IC* server, a change in the *tech.ghp.upper* repository is made. The warning from the *bnd.bnd* file of the provider project is commented as follows:

    Bundle-Version:					1.0.0.${tstamp}
    Bundle-Description: 				\
			A bundle with a provider. Notice that this provider exports the API package. \
			It also provides a JUnit test and it can be run standalone. \
			\
			#${warning;Please update this Bundle-Description in tech.ghp.iot.domotica.provider/bnd.bnd}

The change is *saved* and *pushed* to the *GitHub* server. The *Travis IC* notices the difference and launches a new automatic build of the repository.

###Remote Debugging

The *OSGi enRoute Application* creates also the files *tech.ghp.iot.bndrun* and *debug.bndrun*. The later inherits the former and adds debug bundles. The default (OSGi) port for *Http Server* is *8080*. However this can be changed in the *tech.ghp.iot.bndrun* file. For example to use the port *9090* for the *Http Server*, the following line needs to be added from the *Source* tab of the *tech.ghp.iot.bndrun*:

    -runproperty: or.osgi.service.http.port = 9090 

Additionally *-runpath* and *-runremote*  need to be specified:

    -runpath: biz.aQute.remote.launcher
    -runremote: \
				pi; \
				jdb=1044; \
				host=192.168.x.xx; \
				shell=-1
				
###Connecting to Raspberry Pi

To connect to the *Raspebery Pi* the following command is used:

    $ ssh pi@192.168.x.xx
    
To check the Java version (1.8.0 required) use the command:    
    
    pi@raspberry ! $java -version

[Just Another Package for Java](https://jpm4j.org/#!/) needs to be installed on the *Raspberry Pi*:
    
    pi@raspberrypi ~ $ curl https://bndtools.ci.cloudbees.com/job/bnd.master/719/artifact/dist/bundles/biz.aQute.jpm.run/biz.aQute.jpm.run-3.0.0.jar >jpm.jar    
    pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo java -jar jpm.jar init
    pi@raspberry ~ $ jpm version

*Remote debugging* from *bnd tools* requires and agent running on *Raspbery Pi*. For this purpose the package *biz.aQute.remote.main* needs to be installed:

    pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo jpm install -f biz.aQute.remote.main@*
    
To launch the *bndremote* program in Java debug mode and listen to port 1044, the following command is used:
    
    pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo bndremote -n 192.168.x.xx
    
The *-n* option indicates the host on which the agent is run on. Alternatively the *-a* command can be employed:

	 pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo bndremote -a
	 
The *-a* option indicates that *bndremote* should listen to all interfaces, not just localhost.

If the interfaces to listen to are not specified, only the agent from the localhost (same machine) is used.

###Rapberry Pi Command Code

An instruction to send a message to Rapberry Pi is coded to the *DomoticaCommand* class: 

    @Component
	public class DomoticaCommand {

			@Activate
			void activate() {
				System.out.println("Hello Raspberry Pi");
			}

			@Deactivate
			void deactivate() {
				System.out.println("Goodbye Raspberry Pi");
			}
	}

###Defining a Runtime

The requirements of the *runtime* need to be defined in the *tech.ghp.iot.bndrun* file. These can be defined from the *Run* tab. By default, the requirements are specified via annotations, the application *tech.ghp.iot.domotica.application* is listed in the initial requirements. Other bundles can be added from the *Browse Repos* list (the left side of the *Run* tab). 

As the *Run Requirements* list is complete, the *Resolve* button needs to be pushed in order to get the bundles required by the runtime. This will set the *Run Bundles* list. The *-runbundles* section of the script is overwritten every time the *Resolve* button is pushed (manual editing of the *-runbundles* section would be lost).

Save the file *tech.ghp.iot.domotica.bndrun*. 

Push the button *Debug OSGi* at the right top of the window.

The application is running at the address 

    http://192.168.x.xx:8080/tech.ghp.iot.domotica
    
By pushing the button *To Upper* will transform the string inserted in the dialog window to upper case.

###Debugging

Debugging can be done by setting *breakpoints* and *single step*. A new bundle is generated and gets deployed with every change of the bundle. If changes are made to the code (and saved), a new bundle is generated and gets deployed. If more requirements are defined (or removed) in the *bndrun* file, the respective bundels get deployed (or stopped). 

For example if a change is made to the code to return *lower case* string instead of *upper case*

	 public String getUpper(RESTRequest req, String string) throws Exception {
			return string.toLowerCase();
	}

the running framework will include this change.

N.B.
A warning from Eclipse informs about the changes. The *Continue* button should be pushed.

If there are Javascript or html fragment changes, the page in the browser needs to be refreshed to reload the changes.

Every application project has a *[project_name].bndrun* file and a *debug.bndrun* file.

The principle 'Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)' is applied. The *debug.bndrun* file inherits from the *[project_name].bndrun* file (information already available in the later file is aslo available in the former file) and it includes additional bundles supporting the debugging process. 

As *debug.bndrun* inherits from *[project_name].bndrun*, it has no specified requirements in *Run Requirements*. However, the listed bundels to be added to the debug mode runtime  (*Run Bundles*) should be obtained by pushing *Resolve* button. This will add bundels like Web Console, XRay, etc.

Once the *debug.bndrun* file is saved, the application can be run in debug mode by pushing the button *Debug OSGi*. This run in trace mode, which provides detailed information about the launch process and the ongoing updates. This is triggered by the *-runtrace* flag. This can be set to *false* or removed, if this information is not required.

The *Web Console* can be accessed at the address:

    http://192.168.x.xx:8080/system/console

The *ID* and the *password* are defined by Apache Felix as

    User id: admin
    Password: admin
    
These debugging tools provide valuable insights about the running application. For example, a visualisation of the service layer can be obtained with the *XRay* web console plugin. The running system can be inspected on a browser at the address:

	 http://192.168.x.xx:8080/system/console/xray
	 
![XRay](http://enroute.osgi.org/img/tutorial_base/debug-xray-1.png "A visualisation of the service layer can be obtained with the *XRay* web console plugin. ")

The *triangle* represents the *service*. Connections to the *point* of the triangle indicate the *registration* (points to the object that receives the method calls from the service users). The *base* of the triangle indicate the *client(s)* (call the methods of the service). The *sides* of the triangle indicate *listeners* of the service.

![service symbols](http://enroute.osgi.org/img/tutorial_base/debug-service-0.png "Graphical representation of services in XRay")

The following color codes are used:

* yellow: service is registered and in use
* white, solid border: service is registered and not in use
* white, dashed border: service is not registered and needed by other bundles
* red: serious failure of the service
* orange: service is exported or imported  

The *triangles* represent service *types*, not *instances*.

*XRay* also tracks eventual errors logged by the bundles. It marks the bundle with a warning sign and the log message.

Various *tabs* and *subtabs* can be selected in order to get an overview of the running framework:

* Main
	* HTTP Service
	* X-Ray
* OSGi
	* Bundles
	* Configurations
	* Log Service
	* Services
* Web Console 
	* Licenses
	* System Information
	
The *XRay* plugin returns a page with *Javascript* that pulls the server at given time intervals. The server returns the data which is rendered by a javascript library (d3.js).

Each service type is represented by a rounded corner yellow box.
